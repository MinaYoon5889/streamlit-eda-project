    "1. **High-value electronics purchases may drive overall category dominance.**  \n",
    "   The strong skew in Total_Sales_INR suggests a small number of premium items may disproportionately affect revenue.  \n",
    "   **Hypothesis:** Electronics contains a wider distribution of high-priced products than other categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Delivery experience may influence ratings.**  \n",
    "   The boxplot shows returned or pending orders have lower ratings.  \n",
    "   **Hypothesis:** Delivery_Status is a mediator variable that affects Review_Rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Regional customer preferences differ.**  \n",
    "   The pivot table shows that states favor different product categories.  \n",
    "   **Hypothesis:** Certain states exhibit higher demand for electronics, others for clothing/beauty, suggesting demographic or seasonal factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Payment method selection might correlate with order value.**  \n",
    "   UPI and Credit Card show higher revenue.  \n",
    "   **Hypothesis:** Customers using UPI/Credit Cards tend to make larger purchases compared to COD users.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Ratings may be independent of price.**  \n",

    "### Iteration Signals\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Right-skewed Total Sales suggests need for log-transformation**  \n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Delivery status appears influential**  \n",
    "   Ratings differ sharply across Delivery_Status groups, suggesting we should create a binary variable (Delivered vs Not Delivered) for further analysis.\n",

    "3. **State × Category interactions show segmentation potential**  \n",
    "   Phase 5 may include per-state normalization or category dominance indicators to examine geographic shopping patterns.\n",

    "4. **Surprising finding: Price does not affect rating**  \n",
